# Microarray Differential Gene Analysis
Telomere shortening is shown to regulate adjacent gene expression long before telomere length becomes sufficiently short to trigger cell senescence.(5) While telomeres are well-studied for their tumour suppressor functions, their effects and mechanism on gene expression regulation have not been studied extensively. This project aims to elucidate how
telomere shortening regulates gene expression in normal human myoblasts using microarray data.

An overview of the project is shown below:

Affymetrix microarray data used for this project was obtained from [Robin et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25403178/) and is made available on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48973).
